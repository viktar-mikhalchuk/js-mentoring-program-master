 * 2. BasePage should accept one argument 'url'
 * 3. LoginPage should use the parent constructor and extend it with one argument 'name'
 * 4. BasePage should have open() method that will get 'pageName' as a parameter
 * and return the string: "Open this ${this.url}/${pageName}"
 * 5. Login page should have open() method that will call the parent's open() method passing
 * 'this.name' as a parameter
 * 6. Component class should accept one argument 'type'
 * (will receive values such as 'footer' and 'header')
 * 7. BasePage should have getters footer() and header() that will return new Component's
 * passing 'footer' and 'header' appropriately
 * 8. Component should have review() method that will return the string "I can review ${this.type}"
